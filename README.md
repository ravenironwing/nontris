# Novris is a Tetris-like game written in pygame where color matters.
# Each block is cut from 1 to 5 cells of a 3 by 3 grid.
# You can eliminate lines by completing rows just like in Tetris.
# If you get 4 or more of the same color in a row then it deletes the cells of that color.
# This game has joystick support.
