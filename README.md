#Novris is a Tetris-like game written in pygame where color matters.
Novris is designed to split your attention between shape matching and color matching to exercise your brain.
Each block is cut from a 3 by 3 grid. More complex blocks are less common.
You can eliminate lines by completing rows just like in Tetris.
If you get 4 or more of the same color in a row then it deletes the cells of that color.
This game has joystick support.
